# Brownian-Motion-With-QRNG

This project leverages quantum randomness to simulate the Brownian motion of a particle in a two-dimensional space. By using a Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG), the simulation introduces true randomness that is unattainable with classical pseudo-random number generators. This project aims to demonstrate how quantum-generated random numbers can enhance simulations of physical phenomena, such as the random motion of particles suspended in a fluid. I have enhanced the quantum randomness by utilizing a 29-qubit quantum circuit to generate truly random numbers via quantum superposition and measurement. Later modelled the random movement of a particle in 2D space using the quantum random numbers to determine the direction and magnitude of each step. Finally, I provided a visual representation of the particle's trajectory, showcasing the effects of quantum randomness on the simulation.
